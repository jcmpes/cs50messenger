# cs50messenger
This is a web application developed with Python and Flask.

It is developed by Juan Carlos Marcos and it is my final project for the cs50 - Introduction to Computer Science 2020 course.

The application allows for registered users to exchange written messages.

Messages are saved in a SQL database.

The application is built following the MVC doftware design pattern described in the course.
